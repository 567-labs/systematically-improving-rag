description: >
  Classify user queries into predefined categories based on the type of task requested. 
  This classification system aims to categorize incoming user queries into specific task types, 
  such as authorization requests, content drafting, or time-sensitive information retrieval. 
  
  The purpose is to streamline query processing, improve response accuracy, and potentially 
  route queries to appropriate handling systems or personnel. This classification helps in 
  prioritizing tasks, applying relevant security measures, and ensuring that time-sensitive 
  queries are handled promptly. 
  
  The system uses a set of predefined labels, each with a clear description and examples, 
  to accurately categorize a wide range of user inputs. This approach enables efficient 
  query handling and enhances the overall user experience by providing more targeted and 
  timely responses to various types of requests.

# For each label we show the top `n_examples` examples automatically
n_examples: 2
# Number of similar examples to fetch if we use RAGClassifier vs YAMLClassifer
n_similar_examples: 2
